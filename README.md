# repo-labels-import-export-python3
Import-Export repo labels

Script logic:

1. We have a repo with labes and we want to take the labels and save tham in a json to use tham later
2. First we need login data


`import requests` first install request lib with `pip install requests`
`requests` lib helps you to send http requests to git servers

`import pickle` not used here, when you want to format many datas pickel will help you (simmplerer is with json dump)
